# Ruby on Rails

Web development has come a long way, and choosing the right framework can significantly impact your project’s success. In this blog post, we’ll explore **Ruby on Rails** and **Next.js**, two powerful frameworks for building web applications. We’ll compare their advantages and disadvantages and provide insights on how to build a webpage with Ruby on Rails, similar to [my open-source Next.js portfolio](https://github.com/luthda/nextjs-dev-portfolio).

## What is Ruby on Rails?

[**Ruby on Rails**](https://rubyonrails.org/) is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby. It follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern and emphasizes **Convention over Configuration (CoC)** and **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** principles.

### Advantages of Ruby on Rails

- **Rapid Development**: Rails provides a rich set of tools and libraries that speed up development.
- **Convention over Configuration**: Reduces the number of decisions developers need to make, allowing for a focus on business logic.
- **Active Community**: A large and supportive community contributes to gems (libraries) and offers assistance.
- **Built-in Testing**: Comes with integrated testing tools to ensure code reliability.

### Disadvantages of Ruby on Rails

- **Performance**: Generally slower than frameworks built with compiled languages.
- **Scalability**: Can be challenging to scale for very high-traffic applications without significant optimization.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires learning Ruby and understanding Rails conventions.

## What is Next.js?

### Advantages of Next.js

- **Performance**: Offers excellent performance through SSR and static generation.
- **Flexibility**: Can build both static and dynamic websites.
- **SEO-Friendly**: Server-side rendering improves search engine indexing.
- **JavaScript Ecosystem**: Leverages the vast ecosystem of Node.js and React.

### Disadvantages of Next.js

- **Complexity**: More setup and configuration compared to basic React projects.
- **Server Dependency**: SSR requires a server environment, which can complicate deployment.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires knowledge of React and additional Next.js concepts.

| **Scalability**    | Requires optimization                  | Scales well with modern hosting solutions         |
| **Community**      | Mature and supportive                  | Rapidly growing and vibrant                       |
| **Learning Curve** | Steeper for those unfamiliar with Ruby | Steep if new to React and modern JavaScript       |
| **Deployment**     | Traditionally more complex             | Simplified with platforms like Vercel and Netlify |

## Building a Webpage with Ruby on Rails

Let’s walk through building a simple portfolio webpage with Ruby on Rails, inspired by [my Next.js portfolio](https://github.com/luthda/nextjs-dev-portfolio).

### Getting Started

First, ensure you have Ruby and Rails installed:

```bash
# Install Rails
gem install rails
```

### Setting Up the Project

Create a new Rails application:

```bash
rails new portfolio
cd portfolio
```

Generate a controller for your portfolio:

```bash
rails generate controller Portfolio index
```

### Creating the Portfolio Page

Edit config/routes.rb to set the root path:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
root 'portfolio#index'
end
```

Update the app/views/portfolio/index.html.erb file with your portfolio content:

```html
<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
<p>Here you'll find my projects and experiences.</p>
```

You can add styles by editing app/assets/stylesheets/application.css or using a CSS framework like Bootstrap.

### Running the Application

Start the Rails server:

```bash
rails server
```

Visit <http://localhost:3000> to see your portfolio page.

## Conclusion

Choosing between Ruby on Rails and Next.js depends on your project requirements and personal or team expertise. Rails offers rapid development with a focus on convention, while Next.js provides flexibility and performance benefits of React with server-side rendering.

By understanding the strengths and trade-offs of each framework, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your project goals. Whether you prefer the elegance of Ruby or the ubiquity of JavaScript, both frameworks empower you to build powerful web applications.
